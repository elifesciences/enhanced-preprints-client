            "Prediction errors are differences between expected and actual sensory input and are thought to be key computational signals that drive learning related plasticity. One way that prediction errors could drive learning is by activating neuromodulatory systems to gate plasticity. The catecholaminergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a major neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice exploring a virtual environment, we found that the activity of LC axons in the cortex correlated with the magnitude of unsigned visuomotor prediction errors. LC response profiles were similar in both motor and visual cortical areas, indicating that LC axons broadcast prediction errors throughout the dorsal cortex. While imaging calcium activity in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex, we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC axons facilitated learning of a stimulus-specific suppression of visual responses during locomotion. This plasticity – induced by minutes of LC stimulation – recapitulated the effect of visuomotor learning on a scale that is normally observed during visuomotor development across days. We conclude that prediction errors drive LC activity, and that LC activity facilitates sensorimotor plasticity in the cortex, consistent with a role in modulating learning rates."

            "Through experience with the world, brains learn to predict the sensory feedback generated by movement. For instance, learning the precise relationship between motor commands and the resulting visual feedback is the basis for both feedback control of movements as well as distinguishing self-generated from externally generated sensory feedback. One way that the brain may learn to do this is via predictive processing (",

The framework postulates that specific neurons are responsible for computing discrepancies – known as prediction errors – between the prediction and the actual sensory inputs received. The neocortex has been shown to compute signals consistent with sensorimotor prediction errors (",

            "During the first sensorimotor experience in life, prediction errors should strongly drive learning of an internal model of the world, while later in life, prediction errors should update internal models primarily when overall prediction errors are abundant (for instance, in novel or volatile situations). One way to implement such a developmental or contextual shift in the amount of plasticity induced by a particular prediction error would be a gating signal. The characteristics of a gating signal are that it is activated by prediction errors and that it permits increases in plasticity. In addition, because it is not driving plasticity, but simply gating it, it can be low dimensional (i.e., the same for all neurons). Prime candidates for a gating signal are neuromodulatory systems.

We found that LC axons in both sensory and motor cortical regions respond to unsigned visuomotor prediction errors, i.e., unpredicted visual motion or unpredicted visual halts during locomotion. We then combined optogenetic LC axon stimulation with two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons in V1, to show that the LC greatly facilitates a form of plasticity consistent with predictive visuomotor learning: learned suppression of nasotemporal visual flow responses during forward locomotion. These results support the idea that a key function of the LC is to facilitate prediction error driven cortical plasticity."

Mice underwent habituation to the virtual reality system before calcium imaging of V1 neurons during 1) a closed loop condition with mismatches and 2) an open loop condition with 1 s fixed-speed visual flow stimuli. During imaging, we stimulated ChrimsonR by directing a 637 nm laser through the objective into the imaging window (27 mW/mm",

This suggests that the increase in locomotion driven suppression after LC axon stimulation is caused by a similar form of plasticity to that seen when visuomotor experience is constrained to the virtual reality across days. If this is the case, we should see similarities in the properties of the locomotion driven suppression. First, we looked at the locomotion speed dependence of the suppression. If the negative locomotion modulation index results from learning to suppress visual responses according to a locomotion driven prediction of visual flow, the degree of suppression should depend on locomotion speed. As locomotion speed increased, visual flow responses were increasingly suppressed in coupled trained mice (",

              ]
            },
            "). For nasotemporal visual flow responses in ChrimsonR-expressing mice, locomotion modulation index was positive and did not change with locomotion speed at the start of the imaging session, but after stimulation of LC axons in closed loop conditions, locomotion modulation index became increasingly negative as locomotion speed increased (",
            {

              ]
            },
            "). Thus, the locomotion driven suppression of visual flow emerging after stimulating LC axons in closed loop conditions was locomotion speed dependent in a similar manner to the locomotion driven suppression seen in coupled trained mice. Note that in high ChrimsonR-expressing mice, suppression of visual flow was seen at high locomotion speeds only (",

            "). This could be due to differences in visual flow speed: for coupled trained mice, the stimuli analyzed are visual flow onsets during open loop replay; thus, the visual flow speed will cover a similar range as the locomotion speed distribution of the mice. For high ChrimsonR-expressing mice, the stimuli are presented at a fixed visual flow speed that often exceeds the locomotion speed of the mouse. Thus, the fact that suppression only appears at the highest locomotion speed in these mice is consistent with a suppression of visual flow input based on a locomotion speed dependent expectation. In addition to the similarities in locomotion speed dependence of suppression in the two groups, the pattern of change in locomotion modulation index across different functional layer 2/3 cell groups also appeared similar between high ChrimsonR-expressing and coupled trained mice (",

One way to implement such a measure would be to integrate prediction errors from across the brain and then broadcast this signal back across the brain. Indeed, we found that the LC sends unsigned visuomotor prediction errors non-specifically across the dorsal cortex (",

Models hypothesizing that the LC reports the global inaccuracy of the brain’s internal models suggest that the purpose of this is to increase learning rates in output circuits like the cortex, enabling internal models to be modified more rapidly. In line with this, we found that stimulating cortical LC axons during closed loop visuomotor coupling over minutes reduces and even reverses the canonical locomotion related gain of visual flow responses in layer 2/3 of V1, in a manner specific to the direction of the movement-coupled stimulus (",

However, since the LC will never be acting in isolation and broadcasts its output to different cortical areas, the functional impact of LC axon stimulation in this experiment is strongly suggestive of a role in facilitating plasticity. Future work will be needed to understand the circuit locus of plasticity generated by this paradigm, and its dependence on particular neuromodulators (e.g., dopamine and noradrenaline)."

Second, any ROI without evidence of calcium activity was removed: a fast Fourier transform was used to obtain the power spectrum of the ΔF/F trace. From this, the signal-to-noise ratio of the calcium signal was calculated, where noise was calculated as the average power between 3 and 8 Hz. ROIs with power below a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 in the frequency band from 0.05 to 1 Hz (classified as signal) were excluded. This served to remove uncommon elongated non-axonal ROIs, such as blood vessel walls. Next, due to the lower signal to noise of the axonal recordings, the ΔF/F recorded at 60 Hz was low pass filtered at 10 Hz.

Since we were analyzing the visual and mismatch responses of these groups, we used locomotion onset responses to group neurons to avoid a circular analysis. To compute each neuron’s locomotion onset response, for each onset the average ΔF/F in the 1 s window beginning 2 s prior to locomotion onset was subtracted from the response, before averaging across trials. Average responses to locomotion onsets (quantified in the window 0.66 to 4 s (10 to 60 frames) after onset) in open loop conditions were subtracted from locomotion onset responses in closed loop conditions (where visual flow is concurrent with locomotion) for each neuron.

          "text": "<p><strong>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</strong></p>\n<p>The work presented by Jordan and Keller aims at understanding the role of noradrenergic neuromodulation in the cortex of mice exploring a visual virtual environment. The authors hypothesized that norepinephrine released by Locus Coeruleus (LC) neurons in cortical circuits gates the plasticity of internal models following visuomotor prediction errors. To test this hypothesis, they devised clever experiments that allowed them to manipulate visual flow with respect to locomotion to create prediction errors in visuomotor coupling and measure the related signals in LC axons innervating the cortex using two-photon calcium imaging. They observed calcium responses proportional to absolute prediction errors that were non-specifically broadcast across the dorsal cortex. To understand how these signals contribute to computations performed by V1 neurons in layers 2/3, the authors activated LC noradrenergic inputs using optogenetic stimulations while imaging calcium responses in cortical neurons. Although LC activation had little impact on evoked activity related to visuomotor prediction errors, the authors observed changes in the effect of locomotion on visually evoked activity after repeated LC axons activation that were absent in control mice. Using a clever paradigm where the locomotion modulation index was measured in the same neurons before and after optogenetic manipulations, they confirmed that this plasticity depended on the density of LC axons activated, the visual flow associated with running, and the concurrent visuomotor coupling during LC activation. Based on similar locomotion modulation index dependency on speed observed in mice that develop only with visuomotor experience in the virtual environment, the authors concluded that changes in locomotion modulation index are the result of experience-dependent plasticity occurring at a much faster rate during LC axons optogenetic stimulations.</p>\n<p>The study provides very compelling data on a timely and fascinating topic in neuroscience. The authors carefully designed experiments and corresponding controls to exclude any confounding factors in the interpretation of neuronal activity in LC axons and cortical neurons. The quality of the data and the rigor of the analysis are important strengths of the study. I believe this study will have an important contribution to the field of system neuroscience by shedding new light on the role of a key neuromodulator. The results provide strong support for the claims of the study. However, I also believe that some results could have been strengthened by providing additional analyses and experimental controls. These points are discussed below.</p>\n<p>Calcium signals in LC axons tend to respond with pupil dilation, air puffs, and locomotion as the authors reported. A more quantitative analysis such as a GLM model could help understand the relative contribution (and temporal relationship) of these variables in explaining calcium signals. This could also help compare signals obtained in the sensory and motor cortical domains. Indeed, the comparison in Figure 2 seems a bit incomplete since only \"posterior versus anterior\" comparisons have been performed and not within-group comparisons. I believe it is hard to properly assess differences or similarities between calcium signal amplitude measured in different mice and cranial windows as they are subject to important variability (caused by different levels of viral expression for instance). The authors should at the very least provide a full statistical comparison between/within groups through a GLM model that would provide a more systematic quantification.</p>\n<p>Previous studies using stimulations of the locus coeruleus or local iontophoresis of norepinephrine in sensory cortices have shown robust responses modulations (see McBurney-Lin et al., 2019, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.06.009\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.06.009</a> for a review). The weak modulations observed in this study seem at odds with these reports. Given that the density of ChrimsonR-expressing axons varies across mice and that there are no direct measurements of their activation (besides pupil dilation), it is difficult to appreciate how they impact the local network. How does the density of ChrimsonR-expressing axons compare to the actual density of LC axons in V1? The authors could further discuss this point.</p>\n<p>In the analysis performed in Figure 3, it seems that red light stimulations used to drive ChrimsonR also have an indirect impact on V1 neurons through the retina. Indeed, figure 3D shows a similar response profile for ChrimsonR and control with calcium signals increasing at laser onset (ON response) and offset (OFF response). With that in mind, it is hard to interpret the results shown in Figure 3E-F without seeing the average calcium time course for Control mice. Are the responses following visual flow caused by LC activation or additional visual inputs? The authors should provide additional information to clarify this result.</p>\n<p>Some aspects of the described plasticity process remained unanswered. It is not clear over which time scale the locomotion modulation index changes and how many optogenetic stimulations are necessary or sufficient to saturate this index. Some of these questions could be addressed with the dataset of Figure 3 by measuring this index over different epochs of the imaging session (from early to late) to estimate the dynamics of the ongoing plasticity process (in comparison to control mice). Also, is there any behavioural consequence of plasticity/update of functional representation in V1? If plasticity gated by repeated LC activations reproduced visuomotor responses observed in mice that were exposed to visual stimulation only in the virtual environment, then I would expect to see a change in the locomotion behaviour (such as a change in speed distribution) as a result of the repeated LC stimulation. This would provide more compelling evidence for changes in internal models for visuomotor coupling in relation to its behavioural relevance. An experiment that could confirm the existence of the LC-gated learning process would be to change the gain of the visuomotor coupling and see if mice adapt faster with LC optogenetic activation compared to control mice with no ChrimsonR expression. Authors should discuss how they imagine the behavioural manifestation of this artificially-induced learning process in V1.</p>\n<p>Finally, control mice used as a comparison to mice expressing ChrimsonR in Figure 3 were not injected with a control viral vector expressing a fluorescent protein alone. Although it is unlikely that the procedure of injection could cause the results observed, it would have been a better control for the interpretation of the results.</p>\n"

Are the responses following visual flow caused by LC activation or additional visual inputs? The authors should provide additional information to clarify this result.</p>\n<p>Some aspects of the described plasticity process remained unanswered. It is not clear over which time scale the locomotion modulation index changes and how many optogenetic stimulations are necessary or sufficient to saturate this index. Some of these questions could be addressed with the dataset of Figure 3 by measuring this index over different epochs of the imaging session (from early to late) to estimate the dynamics of the ongoing plasticity process (in comparison to control mice). Also, is there any behavioural consequence of plasticity/update of functional representation in V1? If plasticity gated by repeated LC activations reproduced visuomotor responses observed in mice that were exposed to visual stimulation only in the virtual environment, then I would expect to see a change in the locomotion behaviour (such as a change in speed distribution) as a result of the repeated LC stimulation. This would provide more compelling evidence for changes in internal models for visuomotor coupling in relation to its behavioural relevance. An experiment that could confirm the existence of the LC-gated learning process would be to change the gain of the visuomotor coupling and see if mice adapt faster with LC optogenetic activation compared to control mice with no ChrimsonR expression. Authors should discuss how they imagine the behavioural manifestation of this artificially-induced learning process in V1.</p>\n<p>Finally, control mice used as a comparison to mice expressing ChrimsonR in Figure 3 were not injected with a control viral vector expressing a fluorescent protein alone. Although it is unlikely that the procedure of injection could cause the results observed, it would have been a better control for the interpretation of the results.</p>\n"

The conclusions of this work are in general well supported by the data. There are a couple of points that need to be addressed or tested.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is unclear how LC phasic stimulation used in this study gates cortical plasticity without altering cellular responses (at least at the calcium imaging level). As the authors mentioned that Polack et al 2013 showed a significant effect of NE blockers in membrane potential and firing rate in V1 layer2/3 neurons during locomotion, it would be useful to test the effect of LC silencing (coupled to mismatch training) on both cellular response and cortical plasticity or applying NE antagonists in V1 in addition to LC optical stimulation. The latter experiment will also address which neuromodulator mediates plasticity, given that LC could co-release other modulators such as dopamine (Takeuchi et al. 2016 and Kempadoo et al. 2016). LC silencing experiment would establish a causal effect more convincingly than the activation experiment.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the question of how phasic stimulation could alter plasticity without affecting the response sizes or activity in general, we believe there are possibilities supported by previous literature. It has been shown that catecholamines can gate plasticity by acting on eligibility traces at synapses (He et al., 2015; Hong et al., 2022). In addition, all catecholamine receptors are metabotropic and influence intracellular signaling cascades, e.g., via adenylyl cyclase and phospholipases. Catecholamines can gate LTP and LTD via these signaling pathways <em>in vitro</em> (Seol et al., 2007). Both of these influences on plasticity at the molecular level do not necessitate or predict an effect on calcium activity levels. <em>We will expand on this in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</em></p>\n<p>While a loss of function experiment could add additional corroborating evidence that LC output is required for the plasticity seen, we did not perform loss-of-function experiments for three reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The effects of artificial activity changes around physiological set point are likely not linear for increases and decreases. The problem with a loss of function experiment here is that neuromodulators like noradrenaline affect general aspects neuronal function. This is apparent in Polack et al., 2013: during the pharmacological blocking experiment, the membrane hyperpolarizes, membrane variance becomes very low, and the cells are effectively silenced (Figure 7 of (Polack et al., 2013)), demonstrating an immediate impact on neuronal function when noradrenaline receptor activation is presumably taken below physiological/waking levels. In light of this, if we reduce LC output/noradrenergic receptor activation and find that plasticity is prevented, this could be the result of a direct influence on the plasticity process, or, the result of a disruption of another aspect of neuronal function, like synaptic transmission or spiking. We would therefore challenge the reviewer’s statement that a loss-of-function experiment would establish a causal effect <em>more</em> convincingly than the gain-of-function experiment that we performed.</p></li>\n<li><p>The loss-of-function experiment is technically more difficult both in implementation and interpretation. Control mice show no sign of plasticity in locomotion modulation index (LMI) on the 10-minute timescale (Figure 4J), thus we would not expect to see any effect when blocking plasticity in this experiment. We would need to use dark-rearing and coupled-training of mice in the VR across development to elicit the relevant plasticity ((Attinger et al., 2017); manuscript Figure 5). We would then need to silence LC activity across days of VR experience to prevent the expected physiological levels of plasticity. Applying NE antagonists in V1 over the entire period of development seems very difficult. This would leave optogenetically silencing axons locally, which in addition to the problems of doing this acutely (Mahn et al., 2016; Raimondo et al., 2012), has not been demonstrated to work chronically over the duration of weeks. Thus, a negative result in this experiment will be difficult to interpret, and likely uninformative: We will not be able to distinguish whether the experimental approach did not work, or whether local LC silencing does nothing to plasticity.</p>\n<p>Note that pharmacologically blocking noradrenaline receptors during LC stimulation in the plasticity experiment is also particularly challenging: they would need to be blocked throughout the entire 15 minute duration of the experiment with no changes in concentration of antagonist between the ‘before’ and ‘after’ phases, since the block itself is likely to affect the response size, as seen in Polack et al., 2013, creating a confound for plasticity-related changes in response size. Thus, we make no claim about which particular neuromodulator released by the LC is causing the plasticity.</p></li>\n<li><p>There are several loss-of-function experiments reported in the literature using different developmental plasticity paradigms alongside pharmacological or genetic knockout approaches. These experiments show that chronic suppression of noradrenergic receptor activity prevents ocular dominance plasticity and auditory plasticity (Kasamatsu and Pettigrew, 1976; Shepard et al., 2015). Almost absent from the literature, however, are convincing gain-of-function plasticity experiments.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, we feel that loss-of-function experiments may be a possible direction for future work but, given the technical difficulty and – in our opinion – limited benefit that these experiments, would provide in light of the evidence already provided for the claims we make, we have chosen not to perform these experiments at this time. Note that we already discuss some of the problems with loss-of-function experiments in the discussion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>The cortical responses to NE often exhibit an inverted U-curve, with higher or lower doses of NE showing more inhibitory effects. It is unclear how responses induced by optical LC stimulation compare or interact with the physiological activation of the LC during the mismatch. Since the authors only used one frequency stimulation pattern, some discussion or additional tests with a frequency range would be helpful.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is correct, we do not know how the artificial activation of LC axons relates to physiological activation, e.g. under mismatch. The stimulation strength is intrinsically consistent in our study in the sense that the stimulation level to test for changes in neuronal activity is similar to that used to probe for plasticity effects. We suspect that the artificial activation results in much stronger LC activity than seen during mismatch responses, given that no sign of the plasticity in LMI seen in high ChrimsonR occurs in low ChrimsonR or control mice (Figure 4J). Note, that our conclusions do not rely on the assumption that the stimulation is matched to physiological levels of activation during the visuomotor mismatches that we assayed. The hypothesis that we put forward is that increasing levels of activation of the LC (reflecting increasing rates or amplitude of prediction errors across the brain) will result in increased levels of plasticity. We know that LC axons can reach levels of activity far higher than that seen during visuomotor mismatches, for instance during air puff responses, which constitute a form of positive prediction error (unexpected tactile input) (Figures 2C and S1C).  The visuomotor mismatches used in this study were only used to demonstrate that LC activity is consistent with prediction error signaling. <em>We will expand on these points in the discussion as suggested.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</strong></p>\n<p>[…] The study provides very compelling data on a timely and fascinating topic in neuroscience. The authors carefully designed experiments and corresponding controls to exclude any confounding factors in the interpretation of neuronal activity in LC axons and cortical neurons. The quality of the data and the rigor of the analysis are important strengths of the study. I believe this study will have an important contribution to the field of system neuroscience by shedding new light on the role of a key neuromodulator. The results provide strong support for the claims of the study. However, I also believe that some results could have been strengthened by providing additional analyses and experimental controls. These points are discussed below.</p>\n<p>Calcium signals in LC axons tend to respond with pupil dilation, air puffs, and locomotion as the authors reported. A more quantitative analysis such as a GLM model could help understand the relative contribution (and temporal relationship) of these variables in explaining calcium signals. This could also help compare signals obtained in the sensory and motor cortical domains. Indeed, the comparison in Figure 2 seems a bit incomplete since only \"posterior versus anterior\" comparisons have been performed and not within-group comparisons. I believe it is hard to properly assess differences or similarities between calcium signal amplitude measured in different mice and cranial windows as they are subject to important variability (caused by different levels of viral expression for instance). The authors should at the very least provide a full statistical comparison between/within groups through a GLM model that would provide a more systematic quantification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will implement an improved analysis in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Previous studies using stimulations of the locus coeruleus or local iontophoresis of norepinephrine in sensory cortices have shown robust responses modulations (see McBurney-Lin et al., 2019, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.06.009\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.06.009</a> for a review). The weak modulations observed in this study seem at odds with these reports. Given that the density of ChrimsonR-expressing axons varies across mice and that there are no direct measurements of their activation (besides pupil dilation), it is difficult to appreciate how they impact the local network. How does the density of ChrimsonR-expressing axons compare to the actual density of LC axons in V1? The authors could further discuss this point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of estimating the percentage of cortical axons labelled based on our axon density measurements: we refer to cortical LC axonal immunostaining in the literature to make this comparison. In motor cortex, an average axon density of 0.07 µm/µm2 has been reported (Yin et al., 2021), and 0.09 µm/µm2 in prefrontal cortex (Sakakibara et al., 2021). Density of LC axons varies by cortical area, with higher density in motor cortex and medial areas than sensory areas (Agster et al., 2013): V1 axon density is roughly 70% of that in cingulate cortex (adjacent to motor and prefrontal cortices) (Nomura et al., 2014). So, we approximate a maximum average axon density in V1 of approximately 0.056 µm/µm2. Because these published measurements were made from images taken of tissue volumes with larger z-depth (~ 10 µm) than our reported measurements (~ 1 µm), they appear much larger than the ranges reported in our manuscript (0.002 to 0.007 µm/µm2). We repeated the measurements in our data using images of volumes with 10 µm z-depth, and find that the percentage axons labelled in our study in high ChrimsonR-expressing mice ranges between 0.012 to 0.039 µm/µm2. This corresponds to between 20% to 70% of the density we would expect based on previous work. Note that this is a potentially significant underestimate, and therefore should be used as a lower bound: analyses in the literature use images from immunostaining, where the signal to background ratio is very high. In contrast, we did not transcardially perfuse our mice leading to significant background (especially in the pia/L1, where axon density is high - (Agster et al., 2013; Nomura et al., 2014)), and the intensity of the tdTomato is not especially high. We therefore are likely missing some narrow, dim, and superficial fibers in our analysis.</p>\n<p>We also can quantify how our variance in axonal labelling affects our results: For the dataset in Figure 3, there doesn’t appear to be any correlation between the level of expression and the effect of stimulating the axons on the mismatch or visual flow responses for each animal (Figure R1: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/Yl60hnT\">https://imgur.com/gallery/Yl60hnT</a>), while there is a significant correlation between the level of expression and the pupil dilation, consistent with the dataset shown in Figure 4. Thus, even in the most highly expressing mice, there is no clear effect on average response size at the level of the population. <em>We will add these correlations to the revised manuscript.</em></p>\n<p>To our knowledge, there has not yet been any similar experiment reported utilizing local LC axonal optogenetic stimulation while recording cortical responses, so when comparing our results to those in the literature, there are several important methodological differences to keep in mind. The vast majority of the work demonstrating an effect of LC output/noradrenaline on responses in the cortex has been done using unit recordings, and while results are mixed, these have most often demonstrated a suppressive effect on spontaneous and/or evoked activity in the cortex (McBurney-Lin et al., 2019). In contrast to these studies, we do not see a major effect of LC stimulation either on baseline or evoked calcium activity (Figure 3), and, if anything, we see a minor potentiation of transient visual flow onset responses (see also Figure R2). There could be several reasons why our stimulation does not have the same effect as these older studies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Recording location: Unit recordings are often very biased toward highly active neurons (Margrie et al., 2002) and deeper layers of the cortex, while we are imaging from layer 2/3 – a layer notorious for sparse activity. In one of the few papers to record from superficial layers, it was been demonstrated that deeper layers in V1 are affected differently by LC stimulation methods compared to more superficial ones (Sato et al., 1989), with suppression more common in superficial layers. Thus, some differences between our results and those in the majority of the literature could simply be due to recording depth and the sampling bias of unit recordings.</p></li>\n<li><p>Stimulation method: Most previous studies have manipulated LC output/noradrenaline levels by either iontophoretically applying noradrenergic receptor agonists, or by electrically stimulating the LC. Arguably, even though our optogenetic stimulation is still artificial, it represents a more physiologically relevant activation compared to iontophoresis, since the LC releases a number of neuromodulators including dopamine, and these will be released in a more physiological manner in the spatial domain and in terms of neuromodulator concentration. Electrical stimulation of the LC as used by previous studies differs from our optogenetic method in that LC axons will be stimulated across much wider regions of the brain (affecting both the cortex and many of its inputs), and it is not clear whether the cause of cortical response changes is in cortex or subcortical. In addition, electrical LC stimulation is not cell type specific.</p></li>\n<li><p>Temporal features of stimulation: Few previous studies had the same level of temporal control over manipulating LC output that we had using optogenetics. Given that electrical stimulation generates electrical artifacts, coincident stimulation during the stimulus was not used in previous studies. Instead, the LC is often repeatedly or tonically stimulated, sometimes for many seconds, prior to the stimulus being presented. Iontophoresis also does not have the same temporal specificity and will lead to tonically raised receptor activity over a time course determined by washout times.</p></li>\n<li><p>State specificity: Most previous studies have been performed under anesthesia – which is known to impact noradrenaline levels and LC activity (Müller et al., 2011). Thus, the acute effects of LC stimulation are likely not comparable between anesthesia and in the awake animal.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Due to these differences, it is hard to infer why our results differ compared to other papers. The study with the most similar methodology to ours is (Vazey et al., 2018), which used optogenetic stimulation directly into the mouse LC while recording spiking in deep layers of the somatosensory cortex with extracellular electrodes. Like us, they found that phasic optogenetic stimulation alone did not alter baseline spiking activity (Figure 2F of Vazey et al., 2018), and they found that in layers 5 and 6, short latency transient responses to foot touch were potentiated and recruited by simultaneous LC stimulation. While this finding appears more overt than the small modulations we see, it is qualitatively not so dissimilar from our finding that transient responses appear to be slightly potentiated when visual flow begins (Figure R2). Differences in the degree of the effect may be due to differences in the layers recorded, the proportion of the LC recruited, or the fact anesthesia was used in Vazey et al., 2018.</p>\n<p>Note that we only used one set of stimulation parameters for optogenetic stimulation, and it is always possible that using different parameters would result in different effects. <em>We will add a discussion on the topic to the revised manuscript.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the analysis performed in Figure 3, it seems that red light stimulations used to drive ChrimsonR also have an indirect impact on V1 neurons through the retina. Indeed, figure 3D shows a similar response profile for ChrimsonR and control with calcium signals increasing at laser onset (ON response) and offset (OFF response). With that in mind, it is hard to interpret the results shown in Figure 3E-F without seeing the average calcium time course for Control mice. Are the responses following visual flow caused by LC activation or additional visual inputs? The authors should provide additional information to clarify this result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a good point. When we plot the average difference between the stimulus response alone and the optogenetic stimulation + stimulus response, we do indeed find that there is a transient increase in response at the visual flow onset (and the offset of mismatch, which is where visual flow resumes), and this is only seen in ChrimsonR-expressing mice (Figure R2: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/cqN2Khd\">https://imgur.com/gallery/cqN2Khd</a>). We therefore believe that these enhanced transients at visual flow onset could be due to the effect of ChrimsonR stimulation, and indeed previous studies have shown that LC stimulation can reduce the onset latency and latency jitter of afferent-evoked activity (Devilbiss and Waterhouse, 2004; Lecas, 2004), an effect which could mediate the differences we see. <em>We will add this analysis to the revised manuscript.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some aspects of the described plasticity process remained unanswered. It is not clear over which time scale the locomotion modulation index changes and how many optogenetic stimulations are necessary or sufficient to saturate this index. Some of these questions could be addressed with the dataset of Figure 3 by measuring this index over different epochs of the imaging session (from early to late) to estimate the dynamics of the ongoing plasticity process (in comparison to control mice). Also, is there any behavioural consequence of plasticity/update of functional representation in V1? If plasticity gated by repeated LC activations reproduced visuomotor responses observed in mice that were exposed to visual stimulation only in the virtual environment, then I would expect to see a change in the locomotion behaviour (such as a change in speed distribution) as a result of the repeated LC stimulation. This would provide more compelling evidence for changes in internal models for visuomotor coupling in relation to its behavioural relevance. An experiment that could confirm the existence of the LC-gated learning process would be to change the gain of the visuomotor coupling and see if mice adapt faster with LC optogenetic activation compared to control mice with no ChrimsonR expression. Authors should discuss how they imagine the behavioural manifestation of this artificially-induced learning process in V1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the question of plasticity time course: Unfortunately, owing to the paradigm used in Figure 3, the time course of the plasticity will not be quantifiable from this experiment. This is because in the first 10 minutes, the mouse is in closed loop visuomotor VR experience, undergoing optogenetic stimulation (this is the time period in which we record mismatches). We then shift to the open loop session to quantify the effect of optogenetic stimulation on visual flow responses. Since the plasticity is presumably happening during the closed loop phase, and we have no read-out of the plasticity during this phase (we do not have uncoupled visual flow onsets to quantify LMI in closed loop), it is not possible to track the plasticity over time.</p>\n<p>Regarding the behavioral relevance of the plasticity: The type of plasticity we describe here is consistent with predictive, visuomotor plasticity in the form of a learned suppression of responses to self-generated visual feedback during movement. Intuitive purposes of this type of plasticity would be 1) to enable better detection of external moving objects by suppressing the predictable (and therefore redundant) self-generated visual motion and 2) to better detect changes in the geometry of the world (near objects have a larger visuomotor gain that far objects). In our paradigm, we have no intuitive read-out of the mouse’s perception of these things, and it is not clear to us that they would be reflected in locomotion speed, which does not differ between groups (manuscript Figure S5). Instead, we would need to turn to other paradigms for a clear behavioral read-out of predictive forms of sensorimotor learning: for instance, sensorimotor learning paradigms in the VR (such as those used in (Heindorf et al., 2018; Leinweber et al., 2017)), or novel paradigms that reinforce the mouse for detecting changes in the gain of the VR, or moving objects in the VR, using LC stimulation during the learning phase to assess if this improves acquisition. This is certainly a direction for future work. In the case of a positive effect, however, the link between the precise form of plasticity we quantify in this manuscript and the effect on the behavior would remain indirect, so we see this as beyond the scope of the manuscript. <em>We will add a discussion on this topic to the revised manuscript.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Finally, control mice used as a comparison to mice expressing ChrimsonR in Figure 3 were not injected with a control viral vector expressing a fluorescent protein alone. Although it is unlikely that the procedure of injection could cause the results observed, it would have been a better control for the interpretation of the results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We agree that this indeed would have been a better control. However, we believe that this is fortunately not a major problem for the interpretation of our results for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The control and ChrimsonR expressing mice do not show major differences in the effect of optogenetic LC stimulation at the level of the calcium responses for all results in Figure 3, with the exception of the locomotion modulation indices (Figure 3I). Therefore, in terms of response size, there is no major effect compared to control animals that could be caused by the injection procedure, apart from marginally increased transient responses to visual flow onset – and, as the reviewer notes, it is difficult to see how the injection procedure would cause this effect.</p></li>\n<li><p>The effect on locomotion modulation index (Figure 3I) was replicated with another set of mice in Figure 4C, for which we did have a form of injected control (‘Low ChrimsonR’), which did not show the same plasticity in locomotion modulation index (Figure 4E). We therefore know that at least the injection itself is not resulting in the plasticity effect seen.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Agster, K.L., Mejias-Aponte, C.A., Clark, B.D., Waterhouse, B.D., 2013.
