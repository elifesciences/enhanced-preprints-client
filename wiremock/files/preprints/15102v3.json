Consistent with their hypothesis they observed an increase in cytoplasmic condensate formation with a hyperosmotic challenge to cells, while a hypoosmotic change decreased condensation. However, it is their jump from the nonlinearity of osmolality to concluding that macromolecules can serve to buffer the cytoplasmic osmolality that is questionable, since they provide no direct evidence. It is also worth noting that the formation of condensates can be triggered in giant unilamellar vesicles containing polyethylene glycol and dextran by changes in osmolarity (",

In this case it is possible for the osmolality of the intracellular solution to be greater than that of the extracellular solution in the steady state. As an example, if the osmolality of the extracellular solution is dropped by 30 mOsm a hydrostatic pressure of 0.75 atm (calculated from the van ‘t Hoff equation) will develop across the membrane. Using Laplace’s law, one can calculate the membrane tension required to sustain this pressure, which would be ∼ 180 mN/m for a spherical cell with a radius of 5 μm.
